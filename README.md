HELLO

I made this project alongside Clever Programmer Youtube livestream found here:

I needed a way to show off my portfolio of social media videos so I decided to make a TikTok clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node)

Each video has the sidebar with corresponding icons. Although, I took the creative liberty to replace 'Shares' with 'Views'
The information you see for each video is the data I gathered around the performance of the videos I made. WhiteTaleCoffee has since deleted these videos due to a rebrand but they live forever in this project.

This is the first instance of this project. In the next instance, I'd like to:

1) optimize for mobile view. [video pops out upon click rather than play inside container. This messes with sizing], Also, app should cover entire page on mobile as opposed to boxed in on Desktop.
2) set active classes so that video does not continue to play while scrolling to next video
3) Dynamic 'Likes' in Siderbar. You'll notice you can 'like' the videos, but it doesn't add to the counter since it's a String. 
I'd like to find a way to parse so that upon a like, the counter goes from '221' to '222' or '550k' to '550.1k'
4) fix React Ticker in the footer to stay in a single line [the home-roasting video is the main culprit]
5) text and Views are kind of hard to read. Wonder if I can include an opacity filter underneath [rgba?]

6) BONUS: If I'm feeling real adventurous, I'd like to display comments upon click. Unfortunately, these videos have been deleted on social, so I can't go in and grab real comments, but the functionality and examples would still be fun to create.


HEY! Thanks for reading this. I hope you enjoy it
